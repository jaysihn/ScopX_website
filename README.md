# ScopX Landing Site

A clean, responsive landing page with legal pages.

## Quick Start
- Open `index.html` to preview.
- Replace `assets/img/hero-sample.jpg` with your best hero screenshot.
- Drop marketing screenshots into `assets/img/screenshots/` and update the gallery HTML or add more `<img>` tags.
- Update the App Store / Google Play links in `index.html` (search for `apple-link` and `google-link`).
- Replace contact emails if needed.
- Deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or your own host.

## Structure
- `index.html` – main landing page
- `privacy.html`, `terms.html`, `support.html` – legal/support pages linked in footer
- `assets/css/styles.css` – styles
- `assets/js/main.js` – tiny JS (year auto-fill)
- `assets/img/` – logo & images
